Work day scheduler

Description:
This is a day scheduler that allows the user to write down things to do in certain times to help keep them organized. The page is built in with a feature tha prevents the page from being cleared by refreshing, because it stores the information on the local server. This file contains jquerry, javascript, CSS, and html.

Usage: You can view the content on my Github account at https://github.com/brandon6457/scheduler
